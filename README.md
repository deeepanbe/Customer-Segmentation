# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how unsupervised machine learning can be used to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. It helps businesses understand customer patterns and develop targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Cluster customers into distinct groups using **K-Means algorithm**
- Visualize clusters and identify common traits
- Enable business insights through segmentation

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Sample dataset with features like `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`, `Age`, etc.
- [Mall Customers Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Feature scaling and normalization
3. Elbow method to find optimal number of clusters
4. K-Means clustering implementation
5. Cluster visualization and labeling

---

## 📈 Insights
- Cluster 1: Young, high-spending customers
- Cluster 2: Low-income, low-spending segment
- Cluster 3: Older customers with moderate activity
- Business can target promotions accordingly

---

## 🧠 Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with unsupervised ML
- Visualized multi-dimensional clusters
- Improved feature engineering and interpretation skills
